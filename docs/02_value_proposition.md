# Value Proposition: What Makes ScamBuster Different

## Executive Summary

ScamBuster is a **novel adaptive conversational honeypot** that combines:

1. **Research laboratory approach**: Not just blocking scams, but understanding them
2. **Multi-agent LLM architecture** for realistic, scalable engagement
3. **Hybrid IOC extraction** with 100% precision on audited sample (vs 44% regex-only)
4. **Reinforcement learning** to automatically optimize strategies per scam type
5. **Pilot-proven results**: 150 conversations, 2,213 IOCs, €0.52/month cost

## The Laboratory Vision

### From Reactive to Proactive Intelligence

Traditional security treats scam emails as disposable threats:

```
Scam Email → Block → Forget → No intelligence gained
```

ScamBuster transforms them into research opportunities:

```
Scam Email → Engage → Extract → Analyze → Learn → Share
```

### Observatory Capabilities

| Capability | What It Reveals |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Scam Type Tracking** | Which fraud types are trending (13 categories) |
| **Persona Effectiveness** | Which strategies work best per scam type |
| **IOC Patterns** | When and how scammers reveal indicators |
| **Campaign Attribution** | Linking individual scams to coordinated operations |
| **Evolution Monitoring** | How attacker TTPs change over time |

### Research Questions ScamBuster Answers

1. **What makes scammers stay engaged?** → Duration analysis per persona × scam type
2. **When do IOCs get revealed?** → Message-level extraction timing
3. **Which personas perform best?** → 5.5× variance discovered empirically
4. **How are campaigns organized?** → IOC clustering reveals shared infrastructure

## Core Innovations

### 1. Multi-Agent LLM Architecture

Unlike single-prompt systems, ScamBuster uses **five specialized agents**:

| Agent | Responsibility | Key Achievement |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **ScamClassifier** | Categorize incoming scams | 82% automatic classification across 13 types |
| **IocExtractor** | Extract indicators from messages | 100% precision on audited sample, 34 IOC types |
| **Generator** | Create contextual responses | +35% IOC extraction after IBAN detection |
| **Validator** | Ensure response safety/quality | 95% approval rate (vs 60-70% baseline) |
| **Orchestrator** | Coordinate agents, optimize costs | <€0.0002 per message |

**Why it matters**: Specialized agents outperform monolithic approaches. Each can be optimized independently, and failures are isolated.

### 2. Hybrid IOC Extraction

ScamBuster combines regex patterns with LLM understanding:

| Approach | Precision | Recall | IOC Types |
|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Regex only | 44% | High | 7 basic types |
| LLM only | ~85% | Variable | Unlimited |
| **ScamBuster Hybrid** | **100%*** | High | **34 types** |

*\*Measured on audited sample (N=107 messages). Precision = TP / (TP + FP).*

**Supported IOC types include**:
- Email addresses, phone numbers (international formats)
- Bank accounts (IBAN, SWIFT/BIC, account numbers)
- Cryptocurrency wallets (BTC, ETH, USDT, etc.)
- URLs, domains, IP addresses
- Telegram handles, WhatsApp numbers
- Payment services (Western Union, MoneyGram MTCNs)
- Identity documents, company names

### 3. Adaptive Learning (Research Innovation)

**Novel application of contextual multi-armed bandits to scambaiting.** To our knowledge, this is among the earliest documented implementations combining RL-based persona selection with automated honeypot engagement in a production-oriented, measurable setup.

#### The Problem with Static Strategies

Traditional honeypots use fixed personas and responses:

- Different scam types respond to different personas
- What works for "Nigerian Prince" scams fails for tech support scams
- Human intuition about optimal strategies is often wrong
- The optimal strategy changes as scammers adapt

#### The ScamBuster Solution

**Contextual bandit** that learns automatically:

```
Context (scam type) → Select persona → Observe reward → Update model
```

| Algorithm | Version | Status | Key Properties |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| **ε-greedy** | V1 | ✅ Complete | 80% exploitation, 20% exploration |
| **Thompson Sampling** | V2 | ✅ Complete | Bayesian, zero hyperparameters |

**Reward function** (validated empirically):

```
reward = 0.40 × duration_score
       + 0.25 × total_iocs_score
       + 0.25 × high_value_iocs_score
       + 0.10 × completion_score
```

**Key discovery**: Persona performance varies **5.5× by scam type**. The `elderly_person` persona achieved **48.7 hours engagement** vs 0.3h median.

### 4. Double Validation Pipeline

Every generated response passes through two validation layers:

```
Generator → PolicyGuard (hard rules) → LLM Validator (quality) → Send
```

| Layer | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **PolicyGuard** | Rule-based | Block forbidden content |
| **LLM Validator** | AI-based | Ensure coherence and strategic alignment |

**Result**: 95% approval rate vs 60-70% for single-pass systems.

## Pilot Results (December 2025)

### Controlled Live Deployment (30 Days)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Conversations** | 150 real scammers engaged |
| **IOCs extracted** | 2,213 total |
| **High-value IOCs** | IBANs, phone numbers, crypto wallets |
| **System uptime** | 30 days (0 incidents) |
| **Total cost** | €0.52 |
| **Cost per IOC** | €0.0002 |

> **Metrics scope**: Figures from two observation windows in December 2025. Extended run (~1 month) for stability indicators; controlled validation run for ROI analysis. See [Evaluation Methodology](05_evaluation_methodology.md) for definitions.

### Validation Dataset

| **Statistical significance** | p < 0.001 |
| **Convergence CV** | 0.1703 |
| **Effect size (Cohen's d)** | 0.37 |

### Campaign Attribution Examples

From pilot data, identified patterns suggesting coordinated operations:

| Pattern | Indicator |
|---------|-----------|
| **Shared IBANs** | Same accounts across multiple conversations |
| **Common templates** | Identical message structures |
| **Geographic clustering** | Phone prefixes revealing origin |
| **Infrastructure reuse** | Domains, email patterns |

## ROI Analysis

### Cost Structure

| Component | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|--------------|
| LLM API calls (GPT-4o-mini) | €0.52 |
| Infrastructure (Docker) | Existing |
| Human intervention | Zero |
| **Total** | **€0.52** |

### Value Generated

| Asset | Count | Estimated Value |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Total IOCs | 2,213 | €2-5 each |
| High-value IOCs (IBANs, phones) | ~100 | €50-100 each |
| Campaign attributions | Multiple | €100-500 each |

### ROI Calculation

At conservative estimates (€2/IOC for basic indicators):
- **Base value**: 2,213 × €2 = €4,426
- **ROI**: €4,426 / €0.52 = **~8,500×**

> **Note on value estimates**: These figures reflect **defensive operational value** for SOC/fraud-prevention workflows (triage time saved, faster blocking/reporting, campaign correlation). They do not imply resale and are internal estimates, not claims about commercial markets.
